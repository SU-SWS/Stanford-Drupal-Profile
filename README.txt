A drush make and install profile for new sites on the Drupal Hosting Service at Stanford.

NOTE: The installation profile at root is not the one used on sites.stanford.edu It's just for developing and testing and might change without notice. It also does not necessarily reflect how actual sites will be set up. The one on sites.stanford.edu is in a subdirectory.
