A drush make and install profile for websites on the Stanford Sites Drupal hosting service.

Note: The master branch is empty. 

Leading-edge development occurs on the -dev branch for each Drupal core version (6.x-1.x-dev, 7.x-1.x-dev). These branches may or may not reflect what is installed on sites.stanford.edu.

The -installed branches (6.x-1.x-installed, 7.x-1.x-installed) track what is installed on sites.stanford.edu. Check out the latest tag on one of those branches to match what is currently installed on sites.stanford.edu.

If drush make fails because you do not have access to some of the github repositories referenced in the .make file, run drush make with the --force-complete flag.
