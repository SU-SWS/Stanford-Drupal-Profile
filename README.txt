*NOTE* The Drupal 6 branches of this repository receive maintenance updates only. Please check the latest 7.x branch for new development.

A drush make and Drupal install profile for websites on the Drupal Hosting Service at Stanford ("Stanford Sites").

This branch, 6.x-1.x-installed, tracks what is installed on sites.stanford.edu. Check out the latest tag on this branch to match what is currently installed on sites.stanford.edu.

Leading-edge development occurs on the -dev branch for each Drupal core version (6.x-1.x-dev, 7.x-1.x-dev). Those branches may or may not reflect what is installed on sites.stanford.edu.

If drush make fails because you do not have access to some of the github repositories referenced in the .make file, run drush make with the --force-complete flag.
