Stanford Framework Theme for Drupal 7.x

-- SUMMARY --

Authors: Brian Young, Megan Erin Miller
The Stanford Framework theme is a subtheme of Open Framework, and provides basic Stanford styles and branding as directed by the Stanford Identity Guidelines (http://identity.stanford.edu).

This theme is intended as a base theme for all themes that need the Stanford look-and-feel, and is available by request at http://drupalthemes.stanford.edu.

As a base theme, this theme does not provide fully-polished styles, as it is intended to only provide the basic, reusable styles on which you can create a custom subtheme.

To create your subtheme, copy the subtheme kit folder from within the Open Framework theme files. (http://openframework.stanford.edu)
