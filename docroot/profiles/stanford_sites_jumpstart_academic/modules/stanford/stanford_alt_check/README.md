[Changelog.txt](CHANGELOG.txt)

The Stanford Module feature is used to view and edit images that are missing alt texts. Image alt texts are a
requirement as seen [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html).


Installation

1. Install this module like any other module. [See Drupal Documentation](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7)
2. Navigate to admin/content/images - This page displays all images in image fields. It also provides an easy form to
 edit the alt text directly without viewing the entity.
3. Navigate to admin/content/images/wysiwyg - This page displays all entities that have images in wysiwyg fields that
 are missing alt texts. You can then view the entity and edit the alt text directly.
