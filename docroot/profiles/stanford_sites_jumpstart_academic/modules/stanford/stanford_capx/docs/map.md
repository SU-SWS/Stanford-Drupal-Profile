#Map

The **Map** tab gives you an overview of all of the existing mappings on the site, as well as allows you to create new mappings.

##Entity Mapping

The **Entity Mapping** field should display all valid entity types that you can map. Selecting different entity mapping types will change the options in the **Select bundle** field.

**Note:** The entity that you want to map to needs to exist prior to coming to this page and creating a new mapping.

##Select Bundle

The **Select bundle** field should display all of the bundles available based on the entity type selected. Changing the bundle selected will change the available fields in the **Field Mapping** area.

##Field Mapping

**Note:** depending on what entity type and bundle you choose, you may have up to three dropdown fields to work with (Properties, Fields, and Field Collections). **Properties will always display.**

###Properties

**Properties** are items that are found on every bundle of an entity.

###Fields and Field Collections

**Fields and Field Collections** will only display if there are fields available.

##CAP API Path Values

The **CAP API Path values** are the fields in which you enter the JSON path selectors. You do not need to fill out all options. Leave the fields that you do not need/wish to use blank.

##Data Schema

By clicking the **Open Data Schema** button you can view all of the potential options that are available to populate the CAP API Path values.
