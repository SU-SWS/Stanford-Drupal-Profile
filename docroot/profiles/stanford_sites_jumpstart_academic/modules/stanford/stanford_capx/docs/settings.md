##Organizations

The **Get organization data** button re-syncs the CAP API organization code information with your website. If you are not seeing, or you cannot find, the organization code you are looking for, it may be because the data on your site is out of date. It is recommended that you click this button to sync the latest information to your site.

##Schema Information

The **Schema Information** provided by the CAP API tells your website what profile information is available. This includes the field information that you use to map information from the CAP API to your website through a mapping.

If you are not seeing the information you are looking for, click on the **Get schema information** button to sync the latest information from the CAP API to your site.
