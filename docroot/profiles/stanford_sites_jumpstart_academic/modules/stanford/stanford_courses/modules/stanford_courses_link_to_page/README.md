[Stanford Course Link To Page](modules/stanford_courses_link_to_page)
---
This is a simple module that changes both the Stanford views and the Stanford person reference views to link to the course node instead of the explore courses entry for that node. It is recommended that you enable the Stanford Courses Node View module in order to have an aesthetically pleasing layout.
