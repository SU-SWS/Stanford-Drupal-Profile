INTRODUCTION
------------
The 7.x-2.x branch of the Stanford Events Importer module is a significant upgrade
  from the 7.x-1.x branch. It uses a new version of the API from events.stanford.edu,
  removes the requirement that users input the Feed URL directly, and adds several new
  fields to the Stanford Event content type and associated Feed Importer.
