======================================================
INSTALLATION
======================================================
1. Unpack the context_http_header folder and contents in the appropriate modules directory 
   of your Drupal installation.  Normally sites/all/modules/
   
2. Enable the context_http_header module on the Modules admin page (admin/build/modules)

======================================================
USAGE
======================================================

The main feature of this module is to work with the Context module and provide 
two hooks:

hook_context_http_header_def()
hook_context_http_header_build()

allowing your modules to provide http header changes when entering certain
contexts.


/**
 * hook_context_http_header_def works with Forms API to
 * return a simple form that is used as settings for the context reaction.
 */
function hook_context_http_header_def() {
  return array(
    	// fapi array for your form to use with context
    ),
  );
}

/**
 * hook_context_http_header_build does the work of 
 * building the actual headers that will be injected into the context
 */
function hook_context_http_header_build() {
  // build your headers here
}


* context_http_header will work with Context 3.
See Akamai module for working example of hook usage.

FAQ
======================================================
Q: My reactions aren't showing up in the HTTP headers.  Where is it?
A: Check your htaccess file at the base of your drupal instance.  Any rules set there will override the settings you have in your context.
