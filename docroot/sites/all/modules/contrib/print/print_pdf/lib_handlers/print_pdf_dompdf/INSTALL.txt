dompdf support:
  The dompdf tool produces results that are more faithful to the HTML
  printer-friendly page. Good support of CSS 2.1 and partially CSS3.

  1. Download dompdf from http://code.google.com/p/dompdf/downloads/list
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into one of the
  supported paths.
  3. Check if dompdf_config.inc.php fits your installation. In 99% of cases,
  no changes are necessary, so just try to use it and only edit anything if
  the PDF generation fails.
  4. Grant write access to the lib/fonts directory to your webserver user.
  5. If you're using dompdf-0.5.1, delete the dompdf.php file as it contains
  a security vulnerability
  6. If you're using dompdf-0.6 or later, you can try to enable the Unicode
  support, but you'll need to add some Unicode fonts. See 
  http://groups.google.com/group/dompdf/browse_thread/thread/9f7bc0162b04d5cf
  for further info on this.
  7. Check http://code.google.com/p/dompdf/ for further information.
