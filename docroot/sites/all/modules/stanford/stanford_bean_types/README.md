[Changelog.txt](CHANGELOG.txt)

This module provides default BEAN types. Contained in this feature are the Stanford Banner, Stanford Contact, Stanford Large Block, Stanford Postcard, and Stanford Social Media Connect beans. Site administrators can create any number of these Bean blocks and place them on their site.

**Stanford Banner**
This bean type provides a block with the ability to create image banners. Users can add an image, credits, source information, and a caption.

**Stanford Contact**
This bean type provides a uniform and easy to edit contact block. Users can add an address, fax, phone number, email address, and a number of links. When placed using a Stanford theme end users will see a nicely formatted address block.

**Stanford Large Block**
For larger amounts of content than a traditional side-bar block, this block is also used in larger spaces. Use this when content spans 8 columns. You can insert files and images into your body content. There is no header image.

**Stanford Postcard**
The basic building block of the bean types, this block allows users a lot of flexibility as it has options for image upload, links, and wysiwyg content.

**Stanford Social Media Connect**
This block provides a group of social media icons that link to your social media pages. Included in the options are: Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, LinkedIn, YouTube, Vimeo, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, and Flickr.

**Stanford Large Text Block**
Needs Description.

**Stanford Testimonial Block**
