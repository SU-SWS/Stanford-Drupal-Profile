- New capx_auto_nodetitle module allows for better mapping with stanford_person
- Performance improvement with the handling of files from the CAP API. Now files don't have to be downloaded to check to see if they have changed.
- Performance improvement with the handling of files on the Drupal side of things where previously, copies of the file were made on each profile update and now they are updated in place.
- Updates to profiles that produce errors are now marked an invalidated so that the next time an automatic sync happens the profile tries to get updates again. Previously, if there was an error in a profile the error was logged and the profile stayed put until a change happened on the CAP API side of things or a forced update happened.
