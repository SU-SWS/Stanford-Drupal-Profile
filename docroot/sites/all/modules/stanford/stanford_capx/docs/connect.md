#Connect

The **connect** tab is where you add your username and password to connect to the CAP API.

##Authorization

Before you get started you will need to have authentication credentials. To get authentication credentials,[file a HelpSU request] (https://helpsu.stanford.edu/helpsu/3.0/auth/helpsu-form?pcat=CAP_API&dtemplate=CAP-OAuth-Info) to Administrative Applications/CAP Stanford Profiles.

**Note:** Client ID and Password is specifically for the CAPx module. This is not your SUNet ID or Drupal username and password.

##Advanced

**Endpoint** and **Authentication URI** are the two locations where you communicate with CAP.

**Note:** This section is mainly for development use only.

###Endpoint

The Endpoint is where you request profile information.

###Authentication URI

The Authentication URI is where oauth is handled.
