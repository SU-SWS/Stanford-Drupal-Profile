- Added code climate yaml file
- Protection on form alter for installation when everything is not available.
  This is to prevent a php critical error bug that was stopping installation
  profiles in their tracks.
- HSDO-435: Fixes for missing email attribute. Sometimes a person does not have
  an email attribute but they always have a sunetid. We can cheat an email with
  using the sunet and appending @stanford.edu
- Upgrade path from previous simplesamlphp_auth module. Changes the authmaps to
  the new goodness.
- HSDO-510: HTTP/HTTPS redirect and redirect on login functionality. So you get
  where you are going and are no longer presented an access denied error.
