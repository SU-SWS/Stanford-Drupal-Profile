Open Framework Subtheming Kit for Drupal 7.x

-- SUMMARY -- 

Authors: Megan Erin Miller
This kit is for creating subthemes based on Open Framework (http://openframework.stanford.edu).

-- REQUIREMENTS --

This Stanford custom Drupal theme is intended for Drupal versions 7 only; it will not work with Drupal 6 or below. You must install Open Framework theme 7.x-2.x or higher for this theme to operate properly.

-- SUBTHEMING INSTRUCTIONS --

1) Copy (don't move) the subtheme_kit folder from the Open Framework theme folder.
2) Paste it in your themes directory.
3) Rename the "subtheme_kit" folder to "your-theme-name".
4) In your new "your-theme-name" folder, rename the subtheme_kit.info.txt file to "your-theme-name".info and remove the ".txt" extension.
5) Edit the README.txt for your new theme (this file) and the theme info in the .info file.
6) Once you have renamed everything, you can proceed to the installation instructions below.

To start creating your subtheme, you can use the CSS template included (.css file), or add your own. Add Javascript to the scripts folder. Add your own site logo to replace the logo.png file (keep same name) and your own theme's screenshot (replace screenshot.png). Also you can add a favicon.ico file for your site if you wish.

-- INSTALLATION --

As an admin, go to Administer > Appearance > Themes to enable your subtheme and the Open Framework theme (as it is a required base theme).
